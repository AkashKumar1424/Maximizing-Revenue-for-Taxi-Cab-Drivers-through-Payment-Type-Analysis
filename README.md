Maximizing Revenue for Taxi Cab Drivers through Payment Type Analysis


Problem Statement
The taxi business moves fast, and earning good money is important to keep drivers happy and the business running smoothly. The goal is to use data to help drivers earn more. Specifically, the project is checking if the way customers pay (like cash, card, or app payments) affects how much they are charged for the ride. It’s about understanding if payment methods make any difference in taxi fares.

Objective
The project focuses on running an experiment (A/B test) to see if there’s a difference in the total taxi fares based on how people pay—credit card or cash. Using Python, we’ll do some smart calculations (hypothesis testing and analyzing stats) to find patterns. The goal is to figure out if one payment method leads to higher fares, which can help drivers earn better.

Research Question
Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type and can we nudge customers towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers, without negatively impacting customer experience?
